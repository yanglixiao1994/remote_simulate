This application is split into two part--the controller and the capturer.The Controller send boxes to the capturer which run the unreal engine to simulate the physicy and generates the pointclouds.
The network part uses socket to send and recv data.And the protocal is simple and clean.BTW,it adopts a synchronous mode means that you should wait until you have read/recved data from the peer.
